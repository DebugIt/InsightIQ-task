## Overview

This project is a web application that implements several security measures, including Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), CSRF protection, rate limiting, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.

## Security Features

### 1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**Purpose**:  
CORS is implemented to restrict access to the server only from trusted domains. This prevents unauthorized websites from interacting with the server's API.

**Commands to Implement**:

- Install the CORS package:
  ```bash
  npm install cors

Use the package to enable CORS in your backend (configuring allowed domains and credentials).
Explanation:

The server will only accept requests from approved domains (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for development and your production domains).
Cookies are sent with requests to handle user sessions.
2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection
Purpose:
CSRF protection ensures that malicious sites cannot send unauthorized requests on behalf of users. It uses tokens that are attached to requests to verify that the request is legitimate.

Commands to Implement:

Install the CSRF protection package:
bash
Copy code
npm install csurf
Enable CSRF protection in your routes.
Explanation:

A unique CSRF token is generated for each session. The frontend sends this token with every request.
The backend verifies the token to ensure the request is legitimate, protecting from unauthorized actions.
3. Rate Limiting
Purpose:
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make to the server in a specific time period, protecting the system from abuse and brute-force attacks.

Commands to Implement:

Install the rate limiting package:
bash
Copy code
npm install express-rate-limit
Set up a rate limiter on sensitive routes like login or registration.
Explanation:

The server limits requests to 100 per 15-minute window (for example). After exceeding the limit, users receive a Too many requests message.
This reduces the risk of repeated attacks or excessive traffic from a single IP address.
4. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Authentication
Purpose:
JWT is used to authenticate users by generating a secure token after login. The token is sent back to the frontend and used for subsequent requests to access protected routes.

Commands to Implement:

Install the JWT package:
bash
Copy code
npm install jsonwebtoken
Use JWT for user authentication (signing and verifying tokens).
Explanation:

When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client.
The client stores this token (in cookies or local storage) and includes it in the headers of requests to access protected routes.
The server verifies the token to ensure the user is authenticated before processing the request.
How to Run the Application
Backend Setup
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables for things like database connection and JWT secrets.
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.
Install the frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables for the API base URL and other necessary configurations.
Start the frontend development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Conclusion
This project implements essential security measures to ensure secure communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive user data and preventing malicious activity. By using CORS, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and JWT authentication, we ensure that only legitimate users can access the API, and that the system is protected from common vulnerabilities.
